# Rounded Hub
An executor project made by me a while ago.

# Updated to have a (probably patched) UWP DLL
Now this might work, but I cannot test it since development has been made strictly from the GitHub website only for now, since this project is practically discontinued you could call it.

# How to install?
Simply just download the latest .zip or .tar.gz from "Releases" and extract it. Then open RoundedHub.exe and enjoy! (if it still works)
